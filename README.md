# Tavern Of Worlds
The aim of this project is to bring the system of Silly tavern to all platforms. I found it is a pain for me to try and get silly tavern working on mobile, and having to do it in a browser sucks.... So here we are :). I am going to blunt, at the starts a lot is going to look like silly tavern, because that is going to be the base.


Keep in mind i am going to try to port most of the features over, and add a few i think were missing. Windows / Linux will most likely support everything and mobile devices  will be limited, but the point is, if you have time and money, you could setup a server or Rass Pi to handle the AI model, you can pretty much just enjoy, playing the game or what ever you want to do with it........ Okay now, i know some of you are going to use it for...... and good luck, i am not ging to stop you....


So for the folks at Silly Tavern, thanks for the help and the direction your project is going to give.
